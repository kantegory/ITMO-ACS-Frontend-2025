                <p class="card-text">Maximizing your exercise routine requires more than just showing up at the gym. Here are 10 proven tips to enhance your workouts:</p>
                
                <h5 class="light-blue-text mt-4">1. Proper Warm-Up</h5>
                <p>Always start with 5-10 minutes of dynamic stretching and light cardio to prepare your muscles and prevent injuries.</p>
                
                <h5 class="light-blue-text">2. Stay Hydrated</h5>
                <p>Drink water before, during, and after your workout. Dehydration can significantly impact your performance.</p>
                
                <h5 class="light-blue-text">3. Focus on Form</h5>
                <p>Quality over quantity. Proper form prevents injuries and ensures you're targeting the right muscles.</p>
                
                <h5 class="light-blue-text">4. Progressive Overload</h5>
                <p>Gradually increase the intensity of your workouts to continue making progress and avoid plateaus.</p>
                
                <p class="mt-3"><strong>Remember:</strong> Consistency is key. Even short, regular workouts are more effective than occasional intense sessions.</p>

                <h3 class="card-title light-blue-text mb-3">Nutrition for Athletes</h3>
                <p class="card-text">Proper nutrition is essential for optimal performance and recovery. Here's what every athlete should know:</p>
                
                <h5 class="light-blue-text mt-4">Macronutrient Balance</h5>
                <p>Athletes need the right balance of carbohydrates (for energy), proteins (for muscle repair), and healthy fats (for hormone production).</p>
                
                <h5 class="light-blue-text">Pre-Workout Nutrition</h5>
                <p>Eat a balanced meal 2-3 hours before exercise, focusing on complex carbs and lean protein. For quick energy, have a small snack 30-60 minutes before.</p>
                
                <h5 class="light-blue-text">Post-Workout Recovery</h5>
                <p>Within 30 minutes after exercise, consume protein and carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores and repair muscle tissue.</p>
                
                <h5 class="light-blue-text">Hydration Strategy</h5>
                <p>Water is crucial, but for intense workouts lasting over 60 minutes, consider electrolyte replacement drinks.</p>
                
                <p class="mt-3"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Listen to your body's hunger cues and adjust your intake based on your training intensity.</p>
