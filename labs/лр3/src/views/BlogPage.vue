          <p class="card-text">
            Maximizing your exercise routine requires more than just showing up at the gym.
            Here are 10 proven tips to enhance your workouts and achieve better results:
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text mt-4">1. Proper Warm-Up</h5>
          <p>
            Always start with 5-10 minutes of dynamic stretching and light cardio to prepare
            your muscles and prevent injuries. A good warm-up increases blood flow, raises
            body temperature, and mentally prepares you for the workout ahead.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">2. Stay Hydrated</h5>
          <p>
            Drink water before, during, and after your workout. Dehydration can significantly
            impact your performance, causing fatigue, decreased coordination, and muscle cramps.
            Aim to drink at least 500ml of water 2 hours before exercise.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">3. Focus on Form</h5>
          <p>
            Quality over quantity. Proper form prevents injuries and ensures you're targeting
            the right muscles. If you're unsure about technique, consider working with a trainer
            or watching instructional videos from certified professionals.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">4. Progressive Overload</h5>
          <p>
            Gradually increase the intensity of your workouts to continue making progress and
            avoid plateaus. This can mean adding more weight, increasing repetitions, reducing
            rest time, or adding more challenging exercise variations.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">5. Rest and Recovery</h5>
          <p>
            Your muscles don't grow during workouts — they grow during rest. Ensure you get
            7-9 hours of quality sleep each night and take at least 1-2 rest days per week.
            Recovery is just as important as the training itself.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">6. Track Your Progress</h5>
          <p>
            Keep a workout journal or use a fitness app to track your exercises, weights, sets,
            and reps. This helps you see improvements over time and stay motivated when progress
            seems slow.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">7. Mind-Muscle Connection</h5>
          <p>
            Focus on the muscle you're working during each exercise. This mental connection
            enhances muscle activation and leads to better results. Slow down your movements
            and really feel each contraction.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">8. Vary Your Routine</h5>
          <p>
            Change your workout routine every 4-6 weeks to prevent adaptation and boredom.
            Try new exercises, switch the order of your movements, or experiment with different
            training styles like supersets or circuit training.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">9. Set Realistic Goals</h5>
          <p>
            Define clear, achievable goals for both short-term and long-term. Break big goals
            into smaller milestones and celebrate each achievement. This keeps you motivated
            and gives your training direction.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">10. Listen to Your Body</h5>
          <p>
            Learn to distinguish between productive discomfort and pain that signals injury.
            If something doesn't feel right, stop and assess. Pushing through pain can lead
            to serious injuries that set you back weeks or months.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>Remember:</strong> Consistency is key. Even short, regular workouts are
            more effective than occasional intense sessions. Make exercise a sustainable habit,
            not a punishment.

      <!-- Article 2: Nutrition for Athletes -->
      <div class="card glass-card mb-4">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h3 class="card-title light-blue-text mb-3">Nutrition for Athletes</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            Proper nutrition is essential for optimal performance and recovery. No matter how
            hard you train, you won't see optimal results without fueling your body correctly.
            Here's what every athlete should know:
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text mt-4">Macronutrient Balance</h5>
          <p>
            Athletes need the right balance of carbohydrates (for energy), proteins (for muscle
            repair), and healthy fats (for hormone production). Carbohydrates should make up
            45-65% of your daily calories, protein 15-25%, and fats 20-35%. Good sources include
            whole grains, lean meats, fish, eggs, nuts, and avocados.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">Pre-Workout Nutrition</h5>
          <p>
            Eat a balanced meal 2-3 hours before exercise, focusing on complex carbs and lean
            protein. For quick energy, have a small snack 30-60 minutes before. Good options
            include a banana with peanut butter, Greek yogurt with berries, or oatmeal with honey.
            Avoid high-fat and high-fiber foods right before training.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">Post-Workout Recovery</h5>
          <p>
            Within 30 minutes after exercise, consume protein and carbohydrates to replenish
            glycogen stores and repair muscle tissue. Aim for 20-40g of protein and fast-digesting
            carbs. A protein shake with banana, chicken with rice, or eggs with toast are excellent
            choices for post-workout nutrition.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">Hydration Strategy</h5>
          <p>
            Water is crucial, but for intense workouts lasting over 60 minutes, consider electrolyte
            replacement drinks. Aim for at least 3-4 liters of water per day, more if you're training
            intensely. Signs of dehydration include dark urine, headache, fatigue, and decreased
            performance.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">Meal Timing and Frequency</h5>
          <p>
            Eat every 3-4 hours to maintain stable blood sugar levels and provide a steady stream
            of amino acids for muscle repair. Don't skip breakfast — it jumpstarts your metabolism
            and provides energy for the day. A protein-rich snack before bed can support overnight
            muscle recovery.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">Supplements</h5>
          <p>
            While whole foods should be your primary source of nutrition, some supplements can be
            beneficial. Protein powder, creatine, and omega-3 fatty acids are among the most
            researched and effective options. However, always consult with a healthcare professional
            before starting any supplement regimen.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Listen to your body's hunger cues and adjust your intake
            based on your training intensity. On rest days, you may need fewer calories, while
            heavy training days require more fuel. Nutrition is highly individual — experiment
            to find what works best for you.

      <div class="card glass-card mb-4">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h3 class="card-title light-blue-text mb-3">The Importance of Recovery</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            Many athletes underestimate the power of rest. Recovery is when your body actually
            builds muscle and gets stronger. Here's why rest days are essential:
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text mt-4">Muscle Repair and Growth</h5>
          <p>
            During intense exercise, you create microscopic tears in your muscle fibers. Rest
            allows your body to repair these tears, making the muscles stronger and larger.
            Without adequate recovery, you're breaking down muscle faster than it can rebuild.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">Mental Recovery</h5>
          <p>
            Training is mentally demanding. Rest days prevent burnout, reduce exercise-related
            anxiety, and help maintain long-term motivation. A refreshed mind leads to better
            focus and more productive training sessions.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">Energy Restoration</h5>
          <p>
            Your body replenishes glycogen stores, restores ATP levels, and balances hormones
            during rest. This ensures you have maximum energy available for your next workout.
            Training on depleted energy leads to poor performance and increased injury risk.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">Injury Prevention</h5>
          <p>
            Overtraining syndrome is real and can sideline you for weeks or months. Symptoms
            include persistent fatigue, decreased performance, mood changes, and increased
            susceptibility to illness. Strategic rest days are your best defense.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">Active Recovery Options</h5>
          <p>
            Rest days don't mean complete inactivity. Light walking, yoga, stretching, swimming,
            or foam rolling can enhance blood flow and speed up healing without stressing your
            body. These activities help you stay active while still recovering.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>Warning:</strong> Signs of overtraining include persistent fatigue, insomnia,
            decreased appetite, frequent illness, and declining performance despite hard training.
            If you experience these symptoms, take extra rest and consult a healthcare professional.

          <h3 class="card-title light-blue-text mb-3">Getting Started with Fitness</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            Starting a fitness journey can feel overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be.
            Here's a simple guide for beginners to help you take the first steps:
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text mt-4">Start Slow</h5>
          <p>
            Don't try to do too much too soon. Begin with 2-3 workouts per week and gradually
            increase frequency as your body adapts. Starting with manageable goals prevents
            burnout and reduces injury risk.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">Choose Activities You Enjoy</h5>
          <p>
            The best workout is one you'll actually do. Whether it's swimming, dancing, hiking,
            or weight lifting, find activities that you look forward to. Enjoyment is the key
            to long-term consistency.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">Set Realistic Expectations</h5>
          <p>
            Visible results take time — usually 4-8 weeks of consistent effort. Focus on how
            you feel rather than just how you look. Increased energy, better sleep, and improved
            mood are early signs of progress.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">Find Support</h5>
          <p>
            Whether it's a workout buddy, online community, or personal trainer, having support
            increases your chances of success. Share your goals with others and don't be afraid
            to ask for help when you need it.
          </p>

          <h5 class="light-blue-text">Be Patient with Yourself</h5>
          <p>
            Everyone starts somewhere. Don't compare yourself to people who have been training
            for years. Focus on your own progress and celebrate every small victory along the way.
            Fitness is a lifelong journey, not a destination.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>Final thought:</strong> The hardest part is often just getting started.
            Once you build momentum, it gets easier. Take that first step today — your future
            self will thank you.
